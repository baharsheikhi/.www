<a href = "NA.pdf">Nutrition App</a>
    
<p>This is a sketch of a user interface for an nutrition app for women. Although there are many apps that track food intake, there are not any that just track the nutrients and not the calories. By tracking the nutritional value of foods, the app hopes to make users view healthy eating with a body positive paradigm that is especially needed in the female community. The body-positive approach of this app is further enhanced by tips to promote self-care and a healthy mindset towards eating right. The home page of the app features macronutrients one needs daily, and as users enter in foods that they eat, the icon of the respective macronutrient fills up. It also features water and exercise. This information is represented in icons for clarity. On this page is a link to the different micronutrients, which are represented with a bar that fills up as users fulfill the quota. The tips are on bottom of the main page so that users see it as they enter in what they ate. </p>
<a href="TDLA.pdf">To-Do List Tool</a>
<p> The user interface sketched above is that of a to-do list app. It offers the users the capability to have multiple lists for the different categories of tasks they have to complete—-schoolwork, shopping list, family obligation, etc. The different lists are shown on the homepage all on one page for convenience. The user then taps on one list to open it. Each task in the list is shown with the time needed to complete it. This option is provided in the app because seeing the time needed to tackle something helps reduce procrastination and promotes time management. New tasks are added by pressing the + button at the top right corner; the time needed to complete the task must be added too. As tasks are completed, they are crossed out as one would do on a paper to-do list. This app can be software on a computer, or a mobile app.</p>
<a href="CSA.pdf">Course Selection Helper</a>
<p>Every student at Northeastern—as well as other schools that have old fashioned course selection system—-knows how much of a headache it is to build a multiple iterations of a schedule based on major requirements, class availability, and extracurricular commitments. We are in the 21st century; building a schedule should be as easy as entering in the courses one wants to take during a semester. The user interface of the web tool shown above is for that purpose: students enter in the courses they want to take, as well as preferences on when to take classes, and it shows them all the possible schedules automatically with CRN. The homepage is simple and allows students to enter in the course number of the classes they have to take. The following page is a checklist of preferences, which leads to a page showing all of the possible schedules given the information entered. Seeing all the possibilities at a glance allows users to select whichever one they think is the best in order to get the CRN and be ready for course selection day.</p>
